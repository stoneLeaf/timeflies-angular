## Setup

This project requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) and an instance of [TimeFlies backend API](https://github.com/stoneLeaf/timeflies-backend). With a global install of the [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/), you can then follow these steps:

- clone the repository
- `npm install` to set up the required dependencies
- edit config to set the base URL of the backend API (local or remote)
- `ng serve` to run a dev server

## Development journal

In the same fashion as with my [coding journey](https://github.com/stoneLeaf/coding-journey) and the [back-end development](https://github.com/stoneLeaf/timeflies-backend), I will try to lay out my chain of thoughts and progress.
